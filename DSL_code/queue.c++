/*Implement a real-time event processing system using a Queue data structure. The system
should support the following features:
• Add an Event: When a new event occurs, it should be added to the event queue.
• Process the Next Event: The system should process and remove the event that has
been in the queue the longest.
• Display Pending Events: Show all the events currently waiting to be processed.
• Cancel an Event: An event can be canceled if it has not been processed
